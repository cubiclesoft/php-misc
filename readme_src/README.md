How To Use
----------

See the 'docs' directory for official documentation and example usage.

The 'test.php' file also contains example usage patterns.  Run it via the command-line like this:

````php test.php -e something -f -v -v -v N Y````

The 'test_request.php' file contains example usage patterns for the `Request` class.  Run it via a web server request like:

````http://localhost/path/to/test_request.php?action=test&id=5````

The 'test_colors.php' file performs a variety of color tests.  Requires a XTerm-compatible terminal.  Command Prompt in Windows 10 and later works too!  Run it via the command-line like this:

```php test_colors.php```
